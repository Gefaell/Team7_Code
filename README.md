# TBPS github

In order to do data analysis, you must download all .pkl files from https://imperialcollegelondon.app.box.com/s/mwdgg4uz7hdz56bx6w4loc04qvzb7tmy and place them in the `/data/` folder.
These files are too large to upload to github.

By default .pkl will not be uploaded to github when you upload your code.

Code to load and save .pkl files, as well as an example selector function, are in `core.py` .
Example of how to use this is in `example_of_using_core.py` .
